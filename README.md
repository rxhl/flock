## flock

Flock is a twitter clone in flask.

After writing a lot (~20) react/node apps, I thought it would be a good change to write flask. Some of the features of flock includes:

1. Persistent store (sqlite)
2. Session management (Flask-Login)
3. Basic UI using jinja (feels ancient after writing `JSX` for so long)
4. Image upload and editing (Pillow)
5. Pagination
6. Well defined project structure (venv, packages etc)
7. Hosting (Linode)

### Development

```
1. Create a virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv venv

2. Install required packages
$ pip install xyz
```
